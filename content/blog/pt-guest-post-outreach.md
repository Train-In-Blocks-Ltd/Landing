Want to write a health, diet or fitness guest post?  If you are an expert in these fields and you have good writing skills we’d love to have you write for our blog.

Guest posting is an all around win-win. We get a great article for our readers to enjoy and you get exposure to readers of the blog and our followers on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and elsewhere. Not to mention if you own  a website, guest posting can have great SEO benefits.

Guest posting has many different benefits to you and your business and skillset as a PT.

* Increase your brand awareness and credibility

Brand awareness among your audience and the general public doesn’t happen overnight. It also doesn’t happen from a simple advertisement or marketing campaign. Ensure you promote yourself as more than simply a company and a service and give your audience of the person, or people, behind the brand. \
Guest posting can be a great way to do this as it shows adaptability, self awareness and a willingness to reach out to different demographics even through a potential competitor.Guest blogging is one of the best ways to increase brand awareness with minimal effort. \
You can take advantage of the traffic that’s already arriving at another website to get more eyes on your brand  while offering helpful and relevant content.In other words, you’re not just pushing out your product on people who aren’t ready to buy, but rather writing in your brand voice and presenting yourself as human first, company second. Another great alternative to guest blogging would be publishing [](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sponsored-content-that-doesnt-suck)sponsored content on niche websites.



* Generate referral traffic back to your fitness website
* Connect with peers and build relationships with businesses in their personal training industry
* Use external links of high-authority domains, bloggers to boost DA (domain authority)
* Guest posting is a two-way street that offers mutual benefits for the guest bloggers and the Train In Blocks website where the content will be published.
