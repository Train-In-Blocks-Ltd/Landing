Something a little different this time here at Train In Blocks as we take a moment to take a breather and slow down. As Britain bakes under a heatwave (it definitely counts as one), it's important to tailor your workout to adapt to the hot weather. Be careful not to push too hard or overdo it, and be sure to incorporate plenty of rest between sets to ensure you don't put yourself at risk.

That brings us neatly on to 'mindfulness': a perhaps relatively unknown but nonetheless important element of any training workout. You can look to try and introduce these five different methods into you and your clients' fitness regime making for a far more fulfilling and empowering session. But first, let's have a quick look at what this actually means.

## What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is defined as the human ability to maintain being fully present in the moment, aware of where we are and what we're doing and not be overly reactive or consumed by what's going on around us.
Mindfulness is a quality that we all possess in some way or other; there's no magic conjuring trick, it just takes a bit of practice to tap into it. 
Mindfulness can be used in various ways in a coaching practice. Coaches can use mindfulness as a governing approach and philosophy while coaching clients. Additionally, coaches can weave mindfulness techniques into a coaching session as tactics and tools that accentuate the session. In either situation, mindfulness can enhance the client experience and help clients in a variety of ways.

It's not obscure or exotic, you don't need to change, anyone can do it, it's a way of living and it's evidence based. Both science and experience have demonstrated the positive benefits of mindfulness when it comes to health, happiness, work and relationships. 

## You can incorporate mindfulness into your coaching MO

* Â It is helpful to incorporate a brief body scan, meditation, or visualisation to help become more present before starting any coaching sessions. This will allow you, as the PT, to become more present to the moment and be more prepared to coach effectively. This will also give you a chance to separate from your day to help guide your clients and get them in the right 'head space.'
* Begin the session with 'mindfulness.' When a client checks in with you as normal, take the opportunity to mindfully ensure they have everything they need to begin the session. This gives the client the chance to clear their head and to 'centre' themselves before you begin. This way, it clears their mind ahead of the session.
