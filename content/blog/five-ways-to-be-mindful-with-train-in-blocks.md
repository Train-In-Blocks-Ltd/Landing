postDesc: Incorporate mindfulness into your coaching regime
---
Something a little different this time here at Train In Blocks as we take a moment to take a breather and slow down. As Britain bakes under a heatwave (it definitely counts as one), it's important to tailor your workout to adapt to the hot weather. Be careful not to push too hard or overdo it, and be sure to incorporate plenty of rest between sets to ensure you don't put yourself at risk.

That brings us neatly on to 'mindfulness': a perhaps relatively unknown but nonetheless important element of any training workout. You can look to try and introduce these five different methods into you and your clients' fitness regime making for a far more fulfilling and empowering session. But first, let's have a quick look at what this actually means? 

## What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is defined as the human ability to maintain being fully present in the moment, aware of where we are and what we're doing and not be overly reactive or consumed by what's going on around us.\
Mindfulness is a quality that we all possess in some way or other; there's no magic conjuring trick, it just takes a bit of practice to tap into it. \
Mindfulness can be used in various ways in a coaching practice. Coaches can use mindfulness as a governing approach and philosophy while coaching clients. Additionally, coaches can weave mindfulness techniques into a coaching session as tactics and tools that accentuate the session. In either situation, mindfulness can enhance the client experience and help clients in a variety of ways.
