A solid SEO strategy gives you the best possible chance of getting your website in front of potential clients. Of all the digital marketing channels at your disposal, nothing leaves new personal trainers scratching their head quite like search engine optimisation.

## What is SEO?

SEO is the process of getting traffic from free, organic or natural search results in search engines. It aims to improve your website's position in search results pages. Remember, the higher your website is listed, the more potential clients will see it.

For Train In Blocks, organic traffic has become a key pillar for our overall growth. In fact, search has been so effective for us that we haven’t had to rely on paid advertising at all as we’ve grown our business from start-up to scale-up.

## **Basic SEO Checklist**

What we’ve learned is that while SEO is ultimately a long-term investment, new personal trainers can get a lot of value by building a simple strategy and making sure their website is following recommended on-page practices. To help you do just that, we’ve outlined suggested steps for getting started in an easy-to-follow checklist.

**Buy a custom domain**

A domain name gives an identity to your business. You can find out how to what you need to know about domain names, how to choose the right one, and the steps to take to check if a domain name is available and to register your domain [here](https://mailchimp.com/resources/how-to-buy-a-domain-name/)

**Set up Google Analytics**

The fitness industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the world. A simple Google search for fitness results in millions of pages. People are more health-aware than ever. If you haven’t already, it’s time to make use of your data. Fitness analytics and member insights allow you to fully adapt to your members’ needs and optimize your business.

**Set up Google Search Console**

Search Console is a free tool provided by Google to help webmasters monitor the health of their website. But what is Google Search Console?

Google Search Console provides insight on how a website is doing in organic search as well as ways to make adjustments to the site. (Unlike Google Analytics though, Search Console only provides info on traffic that comes from web search).

**Set up Bing Webmaster tools**

Similarly, Bing Webmaster Tools also allows you to monitor the overall health of your website. It helps you see how your customers are finding your website. You can use tools and reports to find the keywords driving traffic as well as the impressions and clicks of those terms and find websites linking to you.

## What Next?

In this digital world, running a personal training business without a digital presence will be challenging. As a personal trainer, you should be aware that business without a website may lose a large number of opportunities.
