A solid SEO strategy gives you the best possible chance of getting your website in front of potential clients. Of all the digital marketing channels at your disposal, nothing leaves new personal trainers scratching their heads quite like Search Engine Optimisation.

## What is SEO?

SEO is the process of getting traffic from free, organic, or natural search results in Search Engines. It aims to improve your website's position on search results pages. Remember, the higher your website is listed, the more potential clients will see it.

For Train In Blocks, organic traffic has become a key pillar for our overall growth. In fact, search has been so effective for us that we haven’t had to rely on paid advertising at all as we’ve grown our business from start-up to scale-up.

### Set up Analytics

The fitness industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the world. A simple Google search for fitness results in millions of pages. People are more health-aware than ever. If you haven’t already, it’s time to make use of your data. Fitness analytics and member insights allow you to fully adapt to your members’ needs and optimize your business. There are a variety of different analytic tools, and your website builder may have already included one. These tools typically track how many times a page was visited as well as what website people were visiting before coming to your site.

### Set up Google Search Console

Search Console is a free tool provided by Google to help webmasters monitor the health of their website. But what is Google Search Console?

[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) provides insight on how a website is doing in organic search as well as ways to make adjustments to the site. (Unlike Analytics though, Search Console only provides info on traffic that comes from web search).

### Set up Bing Webmaster tools

Similarly, [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/about) also allows you to monitor the overall health of your website. It helps you see how your customers are finding your website. You can use tools and reports to find the keywords driving traffic as well as the impressions and clicks of those terms and find websites linking to you.
