To continually make progress, you should always look to develop a set of core training principles to keep you on your toes. Whether you’re heading back to the gym after a long period away or you’re braving the weight room for the first time, figuring out what actually to do once you hit the gym can be daunting.

The good news is, as long as you know what your goals are and some weight training basics, you’ll be good to get started in the gym — be it a commercial gym or [your personal home gym](https://barbend.com/best-home-gyms/). This piece will help you articulate your workout goals, choose your workout split, decide which exercises to do, figure out how many reps and sets to do, learn how to progress your gym training, and understand how to put it all together into a  sustainable, effective workout program. 

## Establish your goals

It's important to be as specific and precise as possible when it comes to setting your ceiling. Merely aiming to lose weight won't cut it; it's not a goal, just an idea, a desire. Your goal needs to be exact, realistic, within your limits and befitting of your lifestyle. Start small at first, then you can continue to grow when your confidence and fitness improves. Put a timeframe on them as well: a five or six week timespan is best initially. 
Whatever goals you have, there are infinite options and training styles, techniques, exercises, and methods to  get you where you need to be. This leaves a lot of room for creativity, but that creativity must be accompanied by logic, which is where programming gets blurry. Once you’ve got a handle on your main goal(s), you’ll be able to take a deep dive into the nitty-gritty of creating a training program.

## Decide on the frequency

Work out how many days you can dedicate to exercise without compromising on other aspects of life that are important to you. The body has a limited degree of reserves to draw from, and when these get tapped out progress will grind to a halt. This will vary from person to person, which is why some people can grow by training three times a week with little volume and heavy weights, and others need a totally different style. So decide if you want to...

1. Train more frequently – Work out most days a week
2. Train with high intensity – Go heavy or do hard sets close to failure (or both)
3. Train with high volume – Use a high amount of sets, reps, and exercises
