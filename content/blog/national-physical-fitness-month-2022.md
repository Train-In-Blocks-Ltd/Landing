May marks the annual observance of [National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. ](https://health.gov/news/202105/move-may-and-celebrate-national-physical-fitness-sports-month)

Celebrated in the fifth month each year since 1983, NPF&S month provides an opportunity to celebrate and promote physical activity and the benefits of sports participation.

Only further emphasised during life under lockdown, physical activity is key to maintaining health and well-being. Getting active can improve fitness and reduce stress, reduce risk for many chronic diseases, and ease symptoms of anxiety and depression. Youth sports can help kids and teens get active and develop leadership, time management, and relationship-building skills.

Don’t look at National Physical Fitness and Sports Month as a brief 30-day period for you to move around a bit. Instead, look at this month as an opportunity to start a healthy new lifestyle for you and your family that embraces physical fitness.

Being physically active is not only about going to the gym or being part of a sports team, it includes many activities such as swimming, running, jogging, walking, and dancing, anything that involves moving!

You can keep fit at home, too: maybe NPF&S month will inspire you to greater things with[ activities like these](https://traininblocks.com/blog/six-ideas-for-your-fitness-challenge/).

Regular exercise is a vital aspect of our lifestyle:

* It can improve your mood
* It helps build and maintain self esteem and well-being 
* It can reduce stress, anxiety and depression 
* It can help with sleep quality and relaxation
* It reduces risk of chronic disease like heart disease and diabetes

Here are a few ideas on how we can mark an important event in the fitness calendar. 

## Sign up for a road race

Running is the perfect way to get active (or stay active), and May is a great running month. As the weather warms up and the trails shed any last vestiges of snow or ice, now is the time to get out there and start making miles. To keep yourself motivated, sign up for a road race. Countless businesses and organisations throughout the country sponsor road race events in the spring and summer. Bank Holiday weekends are an especially favourite time for these kinds of activities. Look for one near you. If you are getting into running, a 5K or 10K race is a good challenge. If you’ve been running for a while, test your boundaries with a marathon or a half-marathon. 

## Join a local sports group

Getting into fitness can be a terrific way to meet people and make new friends. Look for a sports group, team, or league near you that appeals to your talents and interests. Depending on where you live, you could have a wide range of options available to you, some team sports and some not so competitive (local biking or running groups). Either way, getting involved with a group will help you stay motivated because you’ll be accountable to others as well as yourself. 

## Pick out a cool place to hike

Sometimes, getting active can be as simple as taking a walk in the woods. Set aside some time on the weekend for a hike, then research cool hiking spots near where you live. From recreational trails to nature reserves to national parks, there are no wrong answers here. Just get out there, hike a few miles, and enjoy the scenery. 

## Bike to work for the month

If possible, pledge to bike to work for a month. Not only is this kind of commitment a fantastic way to get your daily exercise, but it’s also an effective way to reduce your carbon footprint. You don’t necessarily have to bike to work every day — especially if it’s raining. However, challenging yourself to do it once a week or so will honour the spirit of National Physical Fitness & Sports Month and might even encourage your co-workers to get involved.

## Get friends or family members together for a physical activity

Next time you get together with friends or family, miss that trip to the pub and arrange a physical activity. A bike ride; a bracing walk by the sea or a good ol' fashioned game of bat and ball.  These kinds of events are all a lot of fun and provide great bonding experiences — all while getting your heart rate up.

There are countless ways to[ celebrate National Physical Fitness & Sports Mont](https://health.gov/news/202004/celebrate-national-physical-fitness-sports-month)h. The five ideas discussed above are just that: ideas. As long as you are finding some way to get active this month, you are playing your part. Just remember to have fun! 

The goal of [](https://health.gov/news/202004/celebrate-national-physical-fitness-sports-month)the event isn’t to force people to exercise but to get them excited about exercising. This month is your chance to find something that you will hopefully want to keep doing even after May has come and gone. Momentum is key!
