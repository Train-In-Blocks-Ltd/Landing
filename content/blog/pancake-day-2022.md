As February gives way to March and spring draws near, Shrove Tuesday marks the start of Lent - 47 days before Easter and, as history suggests, a time of fasting. It's a moveable feast, quite literally, depending on when Easter is, but in 2022 Shrove Tuesday - aka Pancake Day - falls today, on 1st March. It really has 'creped' up on us this year...

Why not cook up your own pancakes - Train In Blocks style - with our healthy version of this much loved and ever popular dessert.

## Origins of Pancake Day

Lent was traditionally a time of famine and  and so to use up the last dregs of the perishables such as eggs, flour, and butter, pancakes were made to provide one last meal before embarking on the pre-Easter fast. The three main ingredients (eggs, flour, and milk) come to symbolise points of significance associated with this time of year: creation, life, and purity respectively. In the UK, traditions such as pancake races and pancake breakfasts are also held on Shrove Tuesday dating back to the 14th century and continuing to this day.

The tradition has spread throughout Europe, with people in France following the trend too - serving waffles and crepes to utilise their dairy products.

## Healthy Pancakes Ingredients

You will need:

* 50g self raising flour
* 50g wholemeal or wholegrain flour
* 2 small eggs
* 150ml skimmed milk
* Berries, fruit or fromage frais to serve

## Now for the how

Put all the flour into a mixing bowl of normal size. Tip any bits left over in the sieve into the bowl, then add the eggs and a splash of milk (but not too much, be sure to leave some for later), then mix together into a thick paste. Add the remaining milk gradually, a little at a time, to ensure your batter isn't too lumpy.

Whisk in the egg whites until they stand up in the 'stiff peak' stage, then fold them carefully into the batter - but be careful not to push out all the air.

Now get a non-stick pan on a medium heat, grease it with some oiled kitchen paper (or put a drop of olive oil in the pan) and pour in enough batter for a pancake roughly 8 - 10cm across.

You'll only need to cook for about a minute until air bubbles come to the surface. Then, flip your pancake over and do the same for the other side.

Keep on a low heat whilst you do the same with the other pancakes and of course you can make as many as you want.

Serve with your favourite healthy toppings - maybe berries, fromage frais, low-fat yoghurt or other fruit (banana is a good option here). Don't forget the obligatory 'toss' of your pancake before eating.

N.B: You can freeze your pancakes for later if you wish - just cover them in foil and store.

So there you have it - quick, easy, healthy and won't cost the earth. Just what the doctor ordered and the perfect way to enjoy Pancake Day whilst keeping your calorie intake in check.
