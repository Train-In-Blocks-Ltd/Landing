Nothing says the great British summer quite like extortionately priced strawberries, a pint of Pimm's and the distant thwack of tennis balls. 

Yes, it's that time of year again when the world's greatest tennis stars descend on a leafy suburb in west London to strut their stuff in front of the world: Wimbledon is back! It's a fortnight when the casual tennis watcher becomes an expert on break points, double faults, net cords and the nuances of the sport's unique scoring system. 

Wimbledon is one of the four majors (also known as the "Grand Slams"), the third such event of the year and the only one played on grass. These tournaments carry the most prestige in terms of prize money, ranking points, media coverage, strength and size of the field and five sets for the men instead of the usual three. 

The very best players have everything you need to be a top tennis star: physical and mental strength, endurance, stamina, agility and athleticism are all integral to the tennis pro's armoury. Whether you’re a tennis newbie inspired to follow in the footsteps of Andy Murray or Emma Raducanu, or a seasoned pro looking to improve your game over the summer, get 'set' for Wimbledon with these tennis-themed exercises to help you feel unbeatable on grass, clay or hard courts. 

**POGO JUMPS**

Jumping exercises like pogo jumps are great for power and conditioning. They help strengthen the quads, hamstrings and calves for tennis players who need to move quickly across the court. Pogo jumps are also one of the most straightforward muscle building exercises you can do, with some of the most notable gains in terms of muscle mass.  

*How to pogo jump:*

Jump as high as you can while pushing off from your ankles instead of your hips and knees (keep knee bending to a minimal). Bounce off the ground as quickly as possible with both feet together and stay on the balls of your feet, avoiding your heels touching the ground.  

Try and master 25 jumps in a row, and repeat the set four times.

**WEIGHTED CHIN-UPS**

Players can use their own body weight to help improve their strength on the tennis court. If you’re new to chin-ups, you can use a resistance band to counter-balance your weight at the beginning of your training. In the weeks and months following, you should slowly work your way up to doing chin-ups without needing any assistance. Once you feel confident, you can introduce using a weighted belt as well.

*How to do a chin-up:*

To perform chin-ups properly, hold a pull-up bar with your hands hip-distance apart and your palms facing inwards. Then, taking as much time as you need, pull your body up with your arms and your lats until your chin is just above the bar, and slowly lengthen your arms back down. You should aim to bring your elbows into your sides

Aim for three sets of 10 pull-ups, and you’ll quickly notice your game strength and "match play" arsenal improving.
