postDesc: Our essential advice for every personal trainer
---
Being a good personal trainer has its perks perhaps more than any other job in the fitness industry - perhaps indeed more than any other job full stop: it's rewarding, it's potentially lucrative, you're making a difference to people's lives, you can become whoever you want to be and there's unlimited potential.

But how do you stand out in a crowded market? Here, we'll explain how you can push your head above the parapet and become a PT your client will want to stay with. Here are Train in Blocks' ten pieces of "must know" advice to get you there.

## Find your niche and 'own it'

Your first port of call should be to start to build your business and develop your brand which will set you apart from the competition.\
It's too simplistic just to say you specialise in 'everything' - decide what you want to focus on specifically and stay with it, whether it be a weight loss expert, a strength and conditioning coach or training those at the peak of their physical fitness. \
If you don't give people a specific reason to work with you, they won't come up with one of your own. Stay true to what you want to achieve, your 'uniqueness' is what makes your niche 'you. 

## **Set your schedule**

By keeping an efficient and well maintained schedule, you immediately appear much more professional and focused to your clients. You will come across as someone who's passionate about what they do, as well as someone who won't let them down by turning up late or prepared or even not at all - all of which are, of course, significant red flags.\
By being organised to a high level, it will also allow you to maintain a strong work/life balance, in turn preventing the risk of fatigue/burnout and preserving your career. This is perhaps the most essential piece of advice we can give you - to always stay organised and structured in your approach.

## **Never stop learning**

This is true in any job - indeed, it's a modern day mantra we can apply in all walks of life. Even after you've gone through your own training journey and are well on the way to becoming a fully-fledged PT, be sure to continue learning and expanding your knowledge. \
The health and fitness industry is always shifting, so it's important to keep up to speed with the latest developments and the winds of change. Not only is there an ever growing raft of books, magazines and journals but we live in the age of the Internet - with tools like YouTube and Instagram, clients and consumers are now more "up to date" than ever.  \
We would definitely recommend incorporating different sources into your everyday working routine.

## Empower your clients

Successful personal trainers should be so much more than simply someone who shapes your body. They have the potential to shape and transform lives too! They build confidence and self esteem, and embody the mantra  that the sky's the limit with dedication and hard work. Bear this in mind when working closely with your clients and consider it's not only WHAT you do, but how you do it. Work on finding out exactly why they want to work with you and use this to encourage and motivate.

Set milestones, help them achieve their goals, communicate the whole way through and rejoice every time that they hit their mark. Communication = motivation and you can also consider getting your clients friends on board too - perhaps set up group sessions with their family and expand to a wider support circle. 

## **Learn from others**

This one is perhaps better suited to those just starting out, but the best place to start is to have a look at those with years in the industry. There's nothing wrong in asking others, to bounce ideas off and to gain a stronger identity as a personal trainer. Consider things like how and where they like to train, any specific target market, plans for future growth as a PT and marketing techniques. \
This will allow you to effectively 'scout' your opposition - armed with this knowledge you can tailor and adapt your services and fitness packages to be different from the rest and exploit gaps in the market. You can become both sustainable and progressive. Maybe even consider working out with another personal trainer to set a good example and to strengthen your learning experience.

## Use social media, but be wary

Building and maintaining an online presence is a vital weapon in your armoury if you want to succeed as a personal trainer. Like it or loathe it, social media can be used to your advantage - whilst it shouldn't consume all your energy and take away your focus from the job at hand, it can help you to develop an online community and reach out to clients. For example, you could create a Facebook group where your clients can ask questions, share ideas, discuss techniques and fitness tips. You could use Instagram to build the aesthetic of your brand and put together a 'teaser' video or a photo reel of your expertise for your followers. \
Creating and managing an online presence also allows you to keep your clients updated - for example, if you're on holiday or in absentia, a simple click of a button or a message will let everyone know at once and saves you a lot of time and effort. 

## Understand your audience

This might sound obvious but it's one of our most important tips. Your clients have their own needs, aspirations and ideas of why they're using a personal trainer and where they want to get to. Think about it like this - if you have interests, a life, and hobbies outside of your work in the gym, so do your clients, and itâ€™s vital that you take those into consideration when planning your sessions.

Always be prepared to go the extra mile, be flexible, adapt, and get to know them on a personal level.
