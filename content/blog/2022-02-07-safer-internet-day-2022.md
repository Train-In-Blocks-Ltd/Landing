postDesc: How to stay online in 2022

You may wonder what a post such as this is doing right here on Train in Blocks.

Well, tomorrow marks the 19th "Safer Internet Day" and it is our belief everyone should play their part in making life safer online, including us here at TiB. So whilst we are a personal training company by trade, we're also part of the safe, secure and strong online community we should all be part of. 

**What is it?**

Celebrated annually on the first Tuesday in February, the aim of Safer Internet Day is to promote the safe and positive use of digital technology for children and young people. Our generation is lucky, growing up as we have in an "online world" but we are all too aware of the perils and the pitfalls that come with the territory. 

Launched in 2004 with EU-funded network *Safer Internet Centres* at the forefront, the day is now marked by over 200 countries with some of those outside the traditional geographic stronghold. 

None of us could live without the Internet - we all use it every day of our lives and it's an essential commodity we take for granted when it comes to modern, every day life. But it carries a risk of exposing some of society's most vulnerable to an entire plethora of problems from cyber security to bullying and trolls. 

The internet is brilliant and a vital educational tool if deployed correctly, but with opportunity comes risks. Te murky depths of the online stratosphere can be toxic and, all too often, what happens behind a headset doesn't stay there. If things go drastically wrong, it can affect who we are and how we behave - even putting lives in danger in some (extreme) cases. 

Safer Internet Day is an event - the biggest in the online calendar - in which almost 2,000 local and national organisations come together from across the globe to raise awareness of online behaviour, emerging issues and current concerns. 

Topics can be anything from consent, ownership, cyber bullying, data, privacy, social networking and digital identity. Of course, the Internet will never be 100% foolproof, but by working together in tandem with children, teens, workplace staff and employers, the ambition is to promote and propose how to be safe when online. 

In 2022, the theme is: "All fun and games: Exploring respect and relationships online" - as the name suggests, it focuses on online gaming, streaming, videos and chat rooms. A number of events will be taking place across the UK including films, workshops, online conferences and social media campaigns. \
From sports clubs and gyms to banks and businesses, people and companies have pledged support across the country. 

**How you can help**

As you'd expect with the world we live it, young people are shaping the interactive entertainment spaces they are part of. 

Whilst of course you don't want to "micro manage" every single aspect of your children's lives, being vigilant and ready to help is an important part of the process.

Talking to your children and young people is a good place to start - encourage them to prioritise who they interact with, and how to think about an online image and identity.\
Discuss looking at privacy settings and choose strong passwords to help them stay in control of what they share, and with whom. 

Monitor internet usage, not to the 'nth' degree but just enough so you know which sites they are using and keep an eye on their browsing history - this way, if you spot even the merest hint of anything which could be even slightly harmful, you can help to nip it in the bud before any potential issues escalates. 

Remember to involve your children in this process - it's important to ask questions and take an interest into what they do - and who they speak with - when online. Try not to be judgemental - you might not approve of their choices but you don't want to be hostile if they ever feel the need to come to you with a mistake or a problem. Always be there to listen to them. 

**Get involved**

So do your bit, get involved and come together to help create a better, safer, more viable internet tomorrow, 8 February.
