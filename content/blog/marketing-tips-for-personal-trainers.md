Being a personal trainer is undoubtedly a challenging but rewarding industry. You are making a pertinent difference to people's lives and watching someone grow and develop before your eyes surely brings an immense feeling of satisfaction. 

But to continue on an upward trajectory, and to get the best out of life in the industry, personal trainers — as self-employed workers — have to be business savvy by marketing themselves and the services they offer.[ In our interview with PT Sean Wilson](https://traininblocks.com/blog/sean-wilson-personal-trainer-interview/), Sean spoke at length about how marketing strategy is a crucial piece of weaponry in a trainer's armoury. 

So with that in mind, Train In Blocks can help you, with a few simple marketing tips, to improve this aspect of your modus operandi. 

## Classes and workshops

People love fresh experiences and trying new things, even more so if these are offered for free. Consider offering taster days or "open house" events either at your business premises, a communal venue like a gym or a college or maybe even your own home. You could try and target specific audiences or events like an Over 60s yoga class, an event exclusively for students or national fitness weeks. A more targeted approach gives you a niche, attracts new businesses and clients and makes everything more cost effective. You will get your name known in the community, build up local contacts and your reputation and allow people to see what you can offer them all out with the promise of improving their lives. 

## Local networking

Many groups, such as home-based business groups, are inexpensive to join. And the marketing benefits of doing so are huge. Once they get to know you and what you do, the other business people in your group will mention your business to others and may even give you referrals thereby expanding your outreach and strengthening your networking.  Such information includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, social media, services and website links. This can help you find clients, investors and staff to enhance your business as a personal trainer.
