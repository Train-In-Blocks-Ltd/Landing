Being a personal trainer is undoubtedly a challenging but rewarding industry. You are making a pertinent difference to people's lives and watching someone grow and develop before your eyes surely brings an immense feeling of satisfaction. 

But to continue on an upward trajectory, and to get the best out of life in the industry, personal trainers — as self-employed workers — have to be business savvy by marketing themselves and the services they offer.[ In our interview with PT Sean Wilson](https://traininblocks.com/blog/sean-wilson-personal-trainer-interview/), Sean spoke at length about how marketing strategy is a crucial piece of weaponry in a trainer's armoury. 

So with that in mind, Train In Blocks can help you, with a few simple marketing tips, to improve this aspect of your modus operandi. 

## Classes and workshops

People love fresh experiences and trying new things, even more so if these are offered for free. Consider offering taster days or "open house" events either at your business premises, a communal venue like a gym or a college or maybe even your own home. You could try and target specific audiences or events like an Over 60s yoga class, an event exclusively for students or national fitness weeks. A more targeted approach gives you a niche, attracts new businesses and clients and makes everything more cost effective. Consider handing out samples or running a competition. 

## Local networking

Many groups, such as home-based business groups, are inexpensive to join. And the marketing benefits of doing so are huge. Once they get to know you and what you do, the other business people in your group will mention your business to others and may even give you referrals thereby expanding your outreach and strengthening your networking.  Such information includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, social media, services and website links. This can help you find clients, potential investors and build a rapport with fellow industry professionals to enhance your business as a personal trainer.

## Blogging

A blog is a great way to build an audience of people who would be interested in your products or services. And [creating a blog ](https://traininblocks.com/blog/)is easier than creating a website, so it takes no time to get one up and running. Not only is it a great opportunity for you to 'sell' yourself as an individual and promote your business as a whole, it will give clients a flavour of how you operate and what to expect if they sign with you. You can write regularly about your business, what it's doing and what you plan to do in the future. You'll start connecting with other bloggers, business people, and potential clients. 

## Consistency is key

A happy customer is a returning customer, and word of mouth is a great and free tool available to you. People trust recommendations from people they know. There is nothing worse than inconsistent service, and if your customer knows they will always get the same from you, they are likely to not only return, but tell others.
However you choose to engage, the number one rule is to not get discouraged if your campaign is not an overnight success. The general rule of thumb is to give it six months to bed in, so keep chipping away to see the rewards for your hard work.

## Referrals

Referrals schemes are a highly effective and fairly low-cost way of [](https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/blog/how-to-get-pt-clients)gaining new clients It essentially capitalises on your existing clients to gain new ones!  But don't just take our word for it. [Statistics have shown](https://www.extole.com/blog/15-referral-marketing-statistics-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=Customers%20acquired%20through%20referrals%20have,in%20profits%20from%20referred%20customers.) that when referred by a friend, customers are 4 times more likely to make a purchase, and customers acquired through referrals have a 37% higher retention rate!  A referral program in personal training is typically when you offer an existing client an incentive to get a friend to sign up. Without an incentive, a client is likely to forget to recommend you to their friends. After all, what would be in it for them? Don't be shy — you can even offer a discount or other incentive to your customers for every referral that turns into a sale.

## Social media engagement

Whether it’s on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn, starting (and continuing) the conversation with people who interact with you on social media is crucial. Engaging with clients on social media will help demonstrate your expertise in the fitness field, which can turn readers into long-term clients. Answer any questions they have and try to provide as much value as possible in every conversation. You can consider posting "before and after" images and videos, fitness tips, competitions, user generated content and "CTAs" (call to action - simply a line of text that prompts viewers to carry out a specific action).
