It's no secret the world of fitness and personal training is a [crowded, chaotic and very competitive one](https://traininblocks.com/blog/improve-your-skillset-as-a-pt/). You don't need us to tell you that. So how can we stand out: what makes Train In Blocks unique in an oversaturated market. In order to stay relevant and gain a competitive advantage in today’s fitness industry, it’s essential to evolve as times change.

So let's take a look at some of the other major players in the game and how Train In Blocks can help you to stay in shape whilst not burning a hole in your wallet.

## How do we compare against...

### [My PT Hub](/compare/pthub/)

The first thing to note is how accessible and easy to use we are in comparison to almost everyone else. Many other fitness or training-based web apps become clouded through complicated pricing and a difficult to follow structure. With Train In Blocks, you can gain instant access, our joining fee is one-size fits all and you get a 14-day free trial which you can cancel at any time. During these first 14 days, you get to try out Train In Blocks and see how it can save you time and become an invaluable partner whilst you're training. To get an an instant idea of what we do just check out our [home page](/).

The benefits of joining us are simply undeniable: easy to use, cancel any time with ease and pay only £9.99/month at one simple price tier, compared to nearly five times that over at [My PT Hub](https://www.mypthub.net/). Train In Blocks was deliberately designed for you, the client, in mind. We bring simplicity to your routine — in short, what you see is what you get. On first viewing, the My PT Hub site appears a little cluttered and their steep pricing, £49 a month, instantly catches the eye.

When creating a workout, our features are relevant and are all brought together in one place with the option for client self-input, but my PT Hub do not offer this, indeed, it seems unclear how their structure works.

One review of us said: *"Really easy to use and does exactly what you need as a fitness coach to provide plans to clients! Can organise sessions well and make your own templates so can do your own description on the exercises which is really good."*

### [PT Distinction](/compare/ptdistinction/)

Here at Train In Blocks, we pride ourselves on flexibility and this allows us to offer you as many clients and number or type of programmes as you want: just another reason why Train In Blocks is your go-to software for all things Personal Training.

Not only are [PT Distinction](https://www.ptdistinction.com/) more expensive than us, even at their most basic level, with their cheapest plan at $19.90 a month (roughly akin to £15 in our money) but they have also made life difficult for those wishing to join as only a certain number of clients can sign up to their three-step structure at any one time (three clients for the cheapest tier, 25 for the most popular 'Pro' tier and a maximum of 50 for their 'Master' tier.

This three-tier pricing plan is difficult to get to grips with and it's unclear exactly what you get at each level. Train In Blocks are one of the only fitness companies to offer one price at £9.99 a month for all of the features.

### [TrueCoach](/compare/truecoach/)

It's not immediately [obvious how TrueCoach](https://truecoach.co/) works, and you then discover they again, like PT Distinction, have a three-tier pricing structure with a limit on the number of clients. They appear very similar to their aforementioned competitors in that they charge £18 for the Starter Plan (only five clients), £40 a month for their most popular Standard Plan (20 active clients) and an eye-popping £74 at their highest 'Pro' plan (50 clients) but each plan appears to be the same apart from the pricing tiers.

### [PT Minder](/compare/ptminder/)

* Charging up to £99 a month, or £200 for unlimited clients
* Doesn't allow you to adapt or change your workout, very specific in structure
* Complex, confusing and very formal layout
* No sense of what they can offer you, or how they're different

### [Trainerize](/compare/trainerize/)

* Corporate feel
* Aimed at a higher class of clientele with prices up to £300 for unlimited clients
* Not clear what the benefits are
* Crazy pricing for something which is unclear
* Rigid structure and no free-form training

With all this in mind, it is clear Train In Blocks should be your go-to software when it comes to your fitness needs, with everything under one roof and a single layer of pricing. [So join us today](https://traininblocks.com/#pricing) and get started on your journey towards those goals. You certainly won't regret it.
