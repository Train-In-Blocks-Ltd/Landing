It's no secret the world of fitness and personal training is a crowded, chaotic and very competitive one. You don't need us to tell you that. So how can we stand out: what makes Train In Blocks unique in an oversaturated market. In order to stay relevant and gain a competitive advantage in today’s fitness industry, it’s essential to evolve as times change.

So let's take a look at some of the other major players in the game and how Train In Blocks can help you to stay in shape whilst not burning a hole in your wallet. 

## How do we compare against....

## My PTHub

[As you will notice, ](https://traininblocks.com/compare/pthub/)the first thing to note is how accessible and easy to use we are when it comes to using our app in comparison to almost everyone else. Many other fitness or training-based web apps become clouded through complicated pricing and a difficult to follow structure. With TIB, you can gain instant access, our joining fee is one-size fits all and you get a 14-day free trial where you can upgrade if you like what you see. You can get an instant idea of what we do without even having to leave the home page. 
The benefits of joining us are simply undeniable: easy to use, cancel any time with ease and pay only £9.99 at one simple price tier, compared to nearly five times that with My PTHub. TIB was deliberately designed for you, the client, in mind, with simplicity in mind — in short, what you see is what you get.  On first viewing, the My PTHub site appears a little cluttered and their steep pricing, £49 a month, instantly catches the eye. 
When creating a workout, our features are relevant and are all brought together in one place with the option for client self-input, but my PtHub do not offer this, indeed, it seems unclear how their structure works. 

One review of us said: *"Really easy to use and does exactly what you need as a fitness coach to provide plans to clients! Can organise sessions well and make your own templates so can do your own description on the exercises which is really good."*

## **PT Distinction**

Here at TIB, we pride ourselves on flexibility and this allows us to have as many clients and number or type of programmes on our app as we want: another USP which makes TIB your go-to software app for all things PT. \
Not only are PT Distinction more expensive than us, even at their most basic level, with their cheapest plan at $19.90 a month (roughly akin to £15 in our money) but they have also made life difficult for those wishing to join as only a certain number of clients can sign up to their three-step structure at any one time (three clients for the cheapest tier, 25 for the most popular 'Pro' tier and a maximum of 50 for their 'Master' tier. \
This three-tier pricing plan is difficult to get to grips with and it's unclear exactly what you get at each level. TIB are the only fitness app to offer the same price band at £10 a month across the board.

## TrueCoach

It's not immediately [obvious how TrueCoach ](https://truecoach.co/)works, and you then discover they again, like PT Distinction, have a three-tier pricing structure with a limit on the number of clients. They appear very similar to their aforementioned competitors in that they charge £18 for the Starter Plan (only five clients), £40 a month for their most popular Standard Plan (20 active clients) and an eye-popping £74 at their highest 'Pro' plan (50 clients) but each plan appears to be the same apart from the pricing tiers — it's not clear exactly what you get for your money. This makes things confusing and lacks clarity for clients, it doesn't explain what you can expect and is very vague. When you go on to TIB site, we clearly explain who we are, what we do and [how we can help you. ](https://traininblocks.com/)

## PT Minder

* Charging up to £99 a month, or £200 for unlimited clients
* Doesn't allow you to adapt or change your workout, very specific in structure
* Complex, confusing and seems very formal in layout
* No sense of what they can offer you, how they're different or what the USP is

## Trainerize

* Corporate feel to the website and services
* Aimed at a higher class of clientele with prices up to £300 for unlimited clients 
* Not clear what the benefits are 
* Crazy pricing for something which is unclear
* Rigid structure and no free-form training

With all this in mind, it is clear Train In Blocks should be your go-to software when it comes to your fitness needs, with everything under one roof and a single layer of pricing. [So join us today ](https://traininblocks.com/)and get started on your journey towards those goals. You certainly won't regret it.
