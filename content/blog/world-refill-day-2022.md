 [World Refill Day ](https://www.refill.org.uk/world-refill-day/)on **16th June** is a global public awareness campaign to prevent plastic pollution and help people live with less waste.
Run by Bristol-based environmental charity *City to Sea,* the annual event aims to help put the issue of single-use plastic back into the national spotlight, with many businesses having banned the use of reusable cups and containers altogether.

## The issue

Plastic pollution has quickly become one of the biggest environmental challenges facing us today. We once  thought of our deepest oceans, our highest mountains and our planetary poles as the final frontiers; unexplored, unknown, and in some places, unreachable. Research has shown this is no longer the case – we’re living in the age of plastic pollution, where even the Antarctic is floating in an invisible plastic soup. These are sad times for our big blue planet.

So how on earth did we get here and what do we need to do to turn off the tap? And how does the production of plastic connect with the other huge threat to our planet – the climate crisis?

Lightweight, cheap to produce and virtually indestructible, plastic has been seen as a miracle material across countless industries. The big problem though is single-use plastic. The stuff you use once and throw away – the stuff we’ve only recently become addicted to, but which now covers our beaches, rivers and floods our   oceans. It’s the everyday items we use at home, in the city — but that end up in the sea.   

## How can you help? 

*Choose to reuse*

Say goodbye to single-use plastic and make small changes by switching to a reusable water bottle, trying a zero-waste shop or using a reusable coffee cup.
