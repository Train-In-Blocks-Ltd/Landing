Train in Blocks launched in 2020 and, although still in the early days, our business has continued to go from strength to strength resulting in the service you see before you. We may be small, but our tight knit team of four all bring something different to the table with our qualities and varied skillsets. But who are we? In the first of a series of blog posts, we sat down with our backroom staff to chat all things TIB. First up, it's Head of Marketing and the only girl on our team. Ladies first...

**Hannah Goodman - Head of Marketing** 

**Hannah, tell us about your Train in Blocks journey? Do you have a favourite project?** 

I’ve worked on a variety of projects in my career with Train In Blocks, and I certainly learned something from each one. If I should pick the best one, however, it would be the competition campaign (can't remember its name) we ran. We focused on influencer marketing, partnering with strong names on Instagram, people who had the right audiences on their social media channels, loyal followers. It worked great, because following their role models, people weren’t afraid to give Train In Blocks a try.

**Where do you see yourself in five years?** 

Right now I'd like to continue to develop my leadership skills, which is why I'm excited about the opportunity to be a marketing manager at Train In Blocks. Additionally, I'm interested in learning more about the technical side of the business. However, I find it most important to find a company that encourages continuous learning, as Train In Blocks does.

**Personal fitness**

I was not what one may call an amazing athletic person. When I went to university I would go work out at a local gym a few times a week with Jamie, but again nothing really consistent. I guess I was lucky and had a higher metabolism then because I ate rubbish and never really worked out. The turning point was around the time I turned 24, I had a personal trainer for a while who really showed me what I was capable of and how to use certain machines. {vid of me and Jamie at the gym}

Building Warhammer miniatures! Some love it, some hate it. It can be a lot of fun if you’re putting together a one-off character hero, but a slog if you’re building 10, 20 or 100 of the same troopers. Nevertheless, I can’t deny the satisfaction of seeing a simple, grey sprue turn into something imposing, dynamic, and fully three-dimensional {pic of warhammer model}
