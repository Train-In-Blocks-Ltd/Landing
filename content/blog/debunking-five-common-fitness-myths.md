## Running alone is not sufficient

Running several times per week is very challenging on the body. It places your joints under enormous strain due to the consistent impact of you hitting the ground, particularly when you run on hard surfaces.\
It is also unachievable for many. If you're struggling to shed the pounds, regularly going for a run isn't sufficient.  It will help in the immediate short term, but to build up long term calorie loss, you need a higher metabolic rate through resistance training. \
Adding more muscle means that your body requires more energy (calories) to recover from your sessions and then maintain that muscle. Therefore, your metabolic rate and calorie burning efficiency increases. This is far more effective and sustainable than just relying on running. Running is great for cardio work but it should be a supplement, not the main course.  To achieve a better body shape, try and aim for something realistic, enjoyable, sustainable, and effective. 

## High protein foods don't guarantee fat loss

A higher protein diet will be beneficial to your weight loss goal, as it will help to change your body shape and help you gain muscle. However, adding in more protein in does not mean you will then make progress.
