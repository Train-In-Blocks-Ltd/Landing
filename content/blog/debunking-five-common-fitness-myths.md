## Running alone is not sufficient        

Running several times per week is very challenging on the body. It places your joints under enormous strain due to the consistent impact of you hitting the ground, particularly when you run on hard surfaces.\
It is also unachievable for many. If you're struggling to shed the pounds, regularly going for a run isn't sufficient.  It will help in the immediate short term, but to build up long term calorie loss, you need a higher metabolic rate through resistance training. \
Adding more muscle means that your body requires more energy (calories) to recover from your sessions and then maintain that muscle. Therefore, your metabolic rate and calorie burning efficiency increases. This is far more effective and sustainable than just relying on running. \
Running is great for cardio work but it should be a supplement, not the main course.  To achieve a better body shape, try and aim for something realistic, enjoyable, sustainable, and effective. 

## High protein foods don't guarantee fat loss

Do you struggle to understand why you canâ€™t lose body fat? You add more protein to your diet but are still unable to make progress? A higher protein diet will be beneficial to your weight loss goal, as it will help to change your body shape and help you gain muscle. \
However, adding in more protein in does not mean you will then make progress in terms of weight and fat loss. It's a common error to prioritise protein over calories. High protein foods are useful, but if they are high in calories they are not the best option when it comes to diet. For leaner food options, consider:    

* Chicken breast over chicken thighs
* Fillet steak over rib eye steak
* Cod over mackerel
* Low fat yoghurt over ordinary yoghurt
* Beans over nuts

\    This will ensure you hit your protein target but also not take your calories overboard, and even giving you room for the occasional treat. It makes the process more enjoyable and allows you to keep the foods you enjoy.

## You don't have to train every day to get in shape

Recovery is an essential part of the process. Do you feel that you have to train with intensity every day to get in shape? Does it make you exhausted and overwhelmed? If you love your sessions, it's easy to fall into this trap and put your best foot forward every day. But this is not necessary or sustainable. Your recovery is also a crucial part of the process. Without it, you will really struggle to be consistent. So, stick to three or four high quality sessions per week, depending on what your body can handle, spread them out across the week, and prioritise recovery along the way.
