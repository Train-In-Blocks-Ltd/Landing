The personal training industry is synonymous with rapid growth in more ways than one, with a 15% increase in fitness coaches since 2019 despite the restraints of the pandemic. In a lucrative market, the rewards for a successful PT are great. There are risks too, but more on that later. 

Here at Train in Blocks we love to be "on trend" and so what better way to promote our industry than by grabbing a word with those "in the know."

When a career in Sport Journalism failed to come to fruition, 25-year-old Sean Wilson, inspired by a love of fitness, embarked on his own personal journey. 

What began as regular gym sessions transcended into a thriving personal training business with Berkshire-based Wilson now an esteemed industry expert in his own right. 

As the UK went into lockdown, Sean took a personal training qualification and, as the old adage says, the rest is history.

We sat down with Sean over Zoom for a fascinating insight on all things fitness.
