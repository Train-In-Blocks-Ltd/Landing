The personal training industry is synonymous with rapid growth in more ways than one, with a 15% increase in fitness coaches in the UK since 2019 despite the restraints of the pandemic. In a lucrative market, the rewards for a successful PT are great. There are risks too, but more on that later. 

Here at Train in Blocks we love to be "on trend" and so what better way to promote our industry than by grabbing a word with those "in the know." 

When a career in Sport Journalism failed to come to fruition, [25-year-old Sean Wilson,](http://seanwilsonfitness.com/) inspired by a love of fitness, embarked on his own personal journey. 

What began as regular gym sessions transcended into a thriving personal training business with Berkshire-based Wilson now an esteemed industry expert in his own right. 

As the UK went into lockdown in March of 2020, Sean took a personal training qualification and, as the old adage says, the rest is history.

We sat down with Sean over Zoom for a fascinating insight on all things fitness.

Let's allow the man himself to take up the story: 

"I’ve been in the industry for two years now and what I’ve found is it's been incredibly rewarding, to help someone and see them change. If you do it right and you develop yourself a lot,  it's an amazing career to have. You have to put in an incredible amount of hard work, but if you have a passion for it, it really is a fantastic industry to be involved in."

As with any job, with reward comes risk and the personal training industry carries a high mortality rate, as Sean explains. 
He adds: "70% of personal trainers don't make it past the first year, the main reason being they look at something like a personal trainer and think, oh that’ll be nice, that will be a good career to go into but then the reality hits and they don’t understand how tough it can be in terms of how many hours you have to work.

"If you're just going off and training people without any outcome, plan or end destination, it's a tough job and you aren't going to be fulfilled. I think a lot of people don’t understand what’s involved and that’s why a lot of people leave. On the other hand, coaching is finding out what someone wants to achieve and then working towards that with them. If your clients are progressing and doing really well, it's remarkably rewarding and an amazing sense of achievement you get as a result." 

It hasn't all been plain sailing for the ambitious sports fanatic though – his fledgling business took the first tentative steps towards becoming [Sean Wilson Fitness ](http://seanwilsonfitness.com/services/)from the cosy confines and the inauspicious surroundings of his garage. Two years on, and Sean has recently moved into his new state-of-the-art studio in Newbury, Berkshire as his career continues to climb from strength to strength.

His love of his job and the profession shines through as Sean has fully embraced being his own boss, controlling his own future and destiny as well as those of his clients. 

 He says: "I absolutely love the transformation of people over time.  Many personal trainers start in gyms but I'm self employed so I love being the master of my own destiny. The problem I had with Sport Journalism was because I was applying for jobs, my destiny was in someone’s else’s hands, i.e the employer. Whereas with this one, every success (or failure) is down to me and I’m 110% fully responsible. It’s an industry where you never know enough in terms of your coaching knowledge, you're constantly learning and always improving which is brilliant."

But there is also a world beyond the fitness studio — as a self employed PT, Sean will often work up to 15 hours a day, not simply coaching his clients but keeping up to speed with the scheduling and financial aspect that comes with the territory of having your own business. Up with the lark at 5.30 and clocking off at 8pm, an essential part of Sean's role entails things like doing the accounts, marketing, content creation, client programming, web design and networking. Whilst all this is important, Sean describes the long days as the main pitfall of his work.  

He stresses the importance of balancing your workload:
"You have to know your limits in terms of how many sessions you do a week for personal training, if you try and chase clients, chase money, you get to the point where your diary is crazy busy and then it’s not sustainable in my view. I do around 30 sessions a week, about six a day. People can do more but I like that number so knowing your limits is very important otherwise you can become burned out very quickly."

Breaking down the barriers by working with a PT to smash through the ceiling can be a daunting prospect for many. It's inevitable some will fall by the wayside (more on that in a moment) but Sean gave us a compelling insight into the secrets of success. 

 "What I try to do with clients when they start with me is to try and find out why do they really want it? It’s not just a bit of weight loss, it’s not just a bit of fat loss or a bit of muscle body. Why is this really important to you? "Whether that be being a role model for your kids or looking great for a wedding or finally meet a partner, you’ve got to link the body shape goal to what’s their real value in life and what’s the real problem for them.  Make it deep and upsetting almost as for a lot of people, it's a very emotional journey."
