The personal training industry is synonymous with rapid growth in more ways than one, with a 15% increase in fitness coaches in the UK since 2019 despite the restraints of the pandemic. In a lucrative market, the rewards for a successful PT are great. There are risks too, but more on that later. 

Here at Train in Blocks we love to be "on trend" and so what better way to promote our industry than by grabbing a word with those "in the know." 

When a career in Sport Journalism failed to come to fruition, [25-year-old Sean Wilson,](http://seanwilsonfitness.com/) inspired by a love of fitness, embarked on his own personal journey. 

What began as regular gym sessions transcended into a thriving personal training business with Berkshire-based Wilson now an esteemed industry expert in his own right. 

As the UK went into lockdown in March of 2020, Sean took a personal training qualification and, as the old adage says, the rest is history.

We sat down with Sean over Zoom for a fascinating insight on all things fitness.

Let's allow the man himself to take up the story: 

"I’ve been in the industry for two years now and what I’ve found is it's been incredibly rewarding, to help someone and see them change. If you do it right and you develop yourself a lot,  it's an amazing career to have. You have to put in an incredible amount of hard work, but if you have a passion for it, it really is a fantastic industry to be involved in."

As with any job, with reward comes risk and the personal training industry carries a high mortality rate, as Sean explains. \
He adds: "70% of personal trainers don't make it past the first year, the main reason being they look at something like a personal trainer and think, oh that’ll be nice, that will be a good career to go into but then the reality hits and they don’t understand how tough it can be in terms of how many hours you have to work.
"If you're just going off and training people without any outcome, plan or end destination, it's a tough job and you aren't going to be fulfilled. I think a lot of people don’t understand what’s involved and that’s why a lot of people leave. On the other hand, coaching is finding out what someone wants to achieve and then working towards that with them. If your clients are progressing and doing really well, it's remarkably rewarding and an amazing sense of achievement you get as a result."
