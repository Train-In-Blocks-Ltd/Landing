I don't know about you, but doesn't it seem like there's a day to mark anything and everything now? We've had Valentine's Day, last week was International Women's Day and it will be Mother's Day next Sunday. May marks World Tea Day and International Dog Day (yes, really) takes place in August to name just but three. 

But whilst these are perhaps reasonably well known, you can bet the vast majority of you reading this didn't know - like me - there was such a thing as World Water Day. Well (no pun intended!) there is and in 2022 it happens to be today, Tuesday 22 March.

Of course, here at TIB we're all too aware of just how important fresh water is - especially when it comes to fitness and a tough session of pumping the iron down the gym. 

## What is it?

World Water Day (WWD) in an annual United Nations observance day, first established in 1993. Its aim is to highlight the importance of fresh water and to champion the use for sustainable management of freshwater resources. WWD celebrates water and raises awareness of the 2 billion people living without access to this most basic yet precious commodity whilst tackling the global water crisis. By the year 2030, WWD aims to support the achievement of Sustainable Development through water and Sanitation for all. 

## How is it marked?

World Water Day is celebrated and marked around the world with a variety of events from economic forums, fundraising efforts, TV adverts, social media campaigns, competitions and educational activities.With climate change, the environment and ecosystem affect and result in the water-crises. Due to floods, drought, water pollution; vegetation, soil, rivers, and lakes are degrading.

For 2022, the theme of WWD is Groundwater: Making the Invisible Visible. The World Water Day this year campaign is built around three main groundwater-related topics and issues, namely: 

* Food's hidden ingredient\
* A resource without borders\
* A finite supply 

Groundwater is a vital resource that provides almost half of all drinking water worldwide, about 40% of water for irrigated agriculture and about 1/3 of water required for world industries. It sustains ecosystems, maintains the base flow of rivers and prevents land subsidence and seawater intrusion. Groundwater is an important part of climate change adaptation process and is often a solution for people without access to safe water.

A World Water Day on groundwater puts a spotlight on this invisible resource, enhance knowledge exchange and collaboration and thereby increase the awareness of the importance of taking care of our groundwater.

## Water and workouts 

Around 65% of our bodies are water, and it of course plays a vital role in every bodily function. You will lose much of this fluid when exercising - on average a litre or two an hour - so it's vital to replenish this supply when exercising in a gym. 

If you don’t top this fluid back up, you can get dehydrated. This can affect both your general health and how well you can exercise. You’ll feel tired more quickly if you’re dehydrated, and you won’t be able to control your temperature as well as usual.

Water helps fuel your muscles, so drinking before, during and after exercise will boost your energy levels, and may help to prevent cramp.

Being dehydrated can affect your energy levels – you won’t be able to work as hard if you haven’t drunk enough fluid. Drinking little and often rather than a lot less often will give you the best chance of hitting your exercise targets - the amount you need to drink depends on how much you sweat and the length and intensity of your workout. A short water break between sets or during quick breaks from cardio can help stave off exercise-induced dehydration, keeping you at your best for consistently high performance.

Commemorate World Water Day on Tuesday by keeping hydrated, drinking plenty of water during your gym workout, and spare a thought for those without access to a precious commodity we all take for granted.
