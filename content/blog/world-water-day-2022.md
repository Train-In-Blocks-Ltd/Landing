Our earth is made up of 70% of the stuff, so it figures the wonderful world of water should get its moment in the national spotlight.

We love how there's a national day for everything now, from women to tea, to dogs, babies and patron saints. Like me, I bet you didn't know there's a World Water Day and this year it takes place today, 22nd March. 

Of course, at TIB we're all too aware of just how important water is, especially when it comes to fitness and a tough session of pumping the iron down the gym. 

In this piece, we'll look into the origins of World Water Day, the idea behind it, how to do your bit and how we can help you here at Train In Blocks. 

## What is it?

World Water Day (WWD) is an annual United Nations observance day, established in 1993 (www.un.org.en). It aims to highlight the importance of fresh water and to champion the use for sustainable management of freshwater resources. WWD celebrates water and raises awareness of the 2 billion people living without access to this most basic yet precious commodity whilst tackling the global water crisis. By the year 2030, WWD aims to support the achievement of Sustainable Development through water and Sanitation for all. 

## How is it marked?

World Water Day is celebrated and marked around the world with a variety of events from economic forums, fundraising efforts, TV adverts, social media campaigns, competitions and educational activities. With climate change, the environment and ecosystem effect, and result in, water crises. Due to floods, drought, water pollution; vegetation, soil, rivers, and lakes are degrading.

For 2022, the theme of WWD is Groundwater: Making the Invisible Visible. The World Water Day campaign this year is built around three main groundwater-related topics and issues, namely: 

* Food's hidden ingredient
* A resource without borders
* A finite supply 

Groundwater is a vital resource that provides almost half of all drinking water worldwide, about 40% of water for irrigated agriculture and about 1/3 of water required for world industries. It sustains ecosystems, maintains rivers base flow and prevents land subsidence and seawater intrusion. Groundwater is an important part of the climate change adaptation process and is often a solution for people without access to safe water.

A World Water Day on groundwater puts a spotlight on this invisible resource, enhance knowledge exchange and collaboration and in turn increase the awareness of the importance of taking care of our groundwater.

Here in the UK, we're no strangers to rain. It feels as if it rains pretty much all the time and that rain is water that we could be using. Rainwater tanks can be installed either in your garden, close to the house or ideally on the roof of your house (if you have a flat roof of course!).

Rainwater harvesting, as it is known, is essentially collecting rainwater in a tank and then pumping it out into the house for use. If the water is to be consumed it will also need to go through a purification process, or you could just have it hooked up to your non-drinking taps, for example, the bath or plumbed into the dishwasher or washing machine. This is just one of the ways in which humanity can help to use water sustainably.  

## Water and workouts

Around 65% of our bodies are comprised of water, and it plays a vital role in every bodily function. You will lose much of this fluid when exercising  on average a litre or two an hour –  so it's vital to replenish this supply whenever exercising. Good hydration is also important for HIIT as mentioned on our blog. 

If you don’t top this fluid back up, you can get dehydrated. This can affect both your general health and how well you can exercise. You’ll feel tired more quickly if you’re dehydrated, and you won’t be able to control your temperature as well as usual. 

Water helps fuel your muscles, so drinking before, during and after exercise will boost your energy levels, and may help to prevent cramps.

Dehydration, when you lose more water than you take in, can affect anyone no matter how healthy. This makes it harder for your body to maintain basic jobs like keeping energy levels up and your temperature steady.

Drinking little and often rather than a lot less often will give you the best chance of hitting your exercise targets - the amount you need to drink depends on how much you sweat and the length and intensity of your workout. A short water break between sets or during quick breaks from cardio can help stave off exercise- induced dehydration, keeping you at your best for consistently high performance.

Commemorate World Water Day on Tuesday by keeping hydrated, drinking plenty of water during your workouts, and spare a thought for those without access to a precious commodity we all take for granted.
