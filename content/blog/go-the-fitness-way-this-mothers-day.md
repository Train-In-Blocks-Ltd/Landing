postDesc: Celebrate Mother's Day in style
---
Hot on the heels of World Water Day comes another celebration of all we hold dear - it's that time of year again, yes, of course, it's Mother's Day. 

Every year we commemorate all things "mum" and this year it falls on Sunday 27th March. Whether she's your real mother, your stepmother or simply the motherly figure in your life, it's time to stop, reflect and simply say thank you to the wonder woman in your life.

In keeping with our raison d'etre here at Fitness HQ, we'll look at how you can treat your mum to the best of both worlds: demonstrating your love and gratitude to one of the most important people in your life whilst also championing healthy living. But more on that in a moment...

## The origins of Mother's Day

It all began in the US of A in 1907 when a young woman called Anna Jarvis held a memorial to honour her own mother and all mothers in Grafton, West Virginia.  This event marked the first official observance of Mother’s Day and in 1914, US President Woodrow Wilson made a proclamation establishing the second Sunday of May as the official date in the US for the observance of a national day to celebrate mothers. The date varies from nation to nation, but the premise remains the same. 

The idea slowly caught on, came to the UK and grew into the celebration we know today. As with all we celebrate, perhaps the traditional side of the occasion has been lost amidst the heavily commercialised world of 21st century Britain.
