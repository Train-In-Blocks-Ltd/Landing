# Working with a client over lockdown

## Introduction

Throughout my journey as a personal trainer, I've had the enjoyable opportunity to work with clients of all ages, genders, and abilities. Some were athletes looking to optimise performance whilst others suffered from chronic health problems wanting to improve their quality of life. I’ve helped all my clients put their best foot forward to change their lives for the better. Today, I’ll share an experience that I’ve had with a more recent client. Here’s a concise breakdown of the plan and what we’ve achieved.

## Barriers and goals

The most immediate obstacle we’ve faced was the lack of equipment and the closure of fitness facilities. Since the first lockdown in March 2020, the client regressed to poor lifestyle choices and eating habits. Like most, he now appreciates the importance of looking after his physical and mental health. He felt ‘sluggish’ most days and was de-motivated to exercise. Adding to the complications, he has arthritis in the hips and worked a busy schedule.

Fortunately, the client owns a turbo trainer (indoor cycling equipment) and lives near a national park. This worked really well with his primary goal of improving his cardiovascular fitness and breaking bad habits. After identifying his reasons for change, we’ve decided on some key SMART goals to move in the right direction. The principle behind SMART goals is that it's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based. For instance, one goal that we've implemented was drinking a pint of water when he wakes up. It is relatively easy to do and very important to re-hydrate after a long period without consuming water. Other goals included: building a yoga routine, staying consistent with the training, and reducing sugary food intake.

## Programming to overcome the obstacles

Starting with a lifestyle remedy, the client was actively encouraged to follow the weekly SMART goals to gradually progress into the plan. These goals were achievable within a few days; for instance, infusing fruits with water to help increase micronutrient and water intake consistently over 5 days. Achieving these ‘mini’ goals were great stepping stones to challenge the client in the upcoming weeks. It promotes a sense of success and possibility which feels — amazing!

Working towards the longer term, the client was given high-intensity interval training on his cycle turbo trainer. He’s mentioned previously that he found steady-state to be mundane. For this reason, Fartlek training was chosen not only for its cardiovascular benefits but for its diversity. Each session was different with a specific focus and varying durations. Supporting both lifestyle and health aspects of this programme, the plan included a range of yoga flows and routines. It has improved flexibility, stability, isometric contraction, and reduced stress levels. From the feedback gathered, the client really enjoyed this type of training with the balanced lifestyle changes. He stated that _“it did not feel like training at all, but rather a way of life”_ — further adding that the yoga has helped the arthritis in his hips.

## Key points to take away

If you are on a similar journey, make sure that you’re breaking down the overall goal into something more manageable. It’s also key to prioritise adherence through actually enjoying your time exercising and making changes. Therefore, include things that you like — and get rid ones that you don’t.
