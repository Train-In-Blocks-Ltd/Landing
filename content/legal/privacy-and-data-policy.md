## 6. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Statement

### 6.1 Overview

We are a Data Controller of your information.

Train In Blocks' legal basis for collecting and using your personal information depends on the specific context in which we collect the information. This includes when:

- Train In Blocks needs to perform a contract with you;

- Train In Blocks needs to comply with the law;
- Train In Blocks will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us at **hello@traininblocks.com** or through our help page on our website.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

- be informed about how your data is being used;
- access personal data;
- have incorrect data updated;
- have data erased;
- stop or restrict the processing of your data;
- data portability (allowing you to get and reuse your data for different services);

### 6.3 Data retention, account deactivation and deletion

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services or until your account is deleted — whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. If you remove a client or unsubscribe from our service, all of your details and information will be deleted after 6 months. You won't be able to recover that information later. During the 6 months, you account status will be deactivated. If you choose to reopen the account, you will still have your basic information available so that we can continue our service to you.

### 6.4 Responding to legal requests

We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. We can also respond to legal requests when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognised standards.

Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.
