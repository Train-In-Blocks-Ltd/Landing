## Bookings

On your client's profile page, you can now schedule bookings wherever or whenever they may be. Your client will also have the ability to request bookings; you will be able to accept or reject their request.

## Client Profile

From their home page, they can add a profile picture, change their details, and request bookings.

## Calendar Links

You can now obtain a link to view current bookings using your calendar of choice (Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc).

## Referral Discounts

We like to reward your loyalty. Get others on-board and we will give you a permanent discount on your subscription. The trainer you refer will also recieve a discount as an incentive.

## Stats Table

Get more information from each session and programme. We've added a table which summarises the data shown in the graph with the date and session it occured at.

## Updated UI

Of course, a new update means a better user interface and experience. We've taken the time to listen to our user's feedback and have made some changes accordingly.

## Offline Support

If you lose connection whilst managing your clients and programmes, Train In Blocks will now attempt to retry and give you access to some functions offline.

## Faster and Smaller

A lot of 'under-the-hood' changes made which improved the speed and size of Train In Blocks.
