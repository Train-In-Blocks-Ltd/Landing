We've been working on Train In Blocks for close to 6 months and are excited to share with you our efforts. Train In Blocks is a personal training software to fuel your growth and build deeper relationships with your clients. If you've heard of TrueCoach, PTminder, Trainerize, MyPTHub, or PTDistinction, then you know what we're trying to achieve. We're aiming to be cheaper and easier to use, all whilst maintaining your strong methodology of helping clients. Let us help you take your PT journey to the next step.
