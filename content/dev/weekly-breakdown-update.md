## Weekly Breakdown Email

Train In Blocks now let’s you know how you’ve been performing by giving you an email breakdown of your previous weeks' work, whilst also setting you up for next week by letting you know about all your upcoming bookings.

These emails will go straight to your inbox every Monday morning but you can opt out by heading to your settings.
