# Tracking data and visualising the results

<br>

## The format

Firstly, make sure that you have some data to track using our standardised format. **The characters/word in bold are important and must be included.**

<br>

### Example 1

**\[** Exercise Name**:** Sets **x** Reps **at** Load/Load/… **\]**

_\[ Back squat: 4 x 4 at 60/70/80/85kg \]_

This will track and break down the sets, reps and load into their own dataset. You will be able to view this in the _statistics_ tab. This will also calculate the volume for this exercise and the overall plan.

This format can track multiple sets at different loads. Please note that the unit of measure (e.g. kg or lbs) must be at the end if you wish to include it.

<br>

### Example 2

**\[** Exercise Name**:** Sets **x** Reps **at** Single Load**\]**

_\[ Back squat: 4 x 4 at 80kg \]_

is the same as…

_\[ Back squat: 4 x 4 at 80/80/80/80kg \]_

This will do the same as the above but the single load will be used for all sets.

<br>

### Example 3

**\[** Measurement**:** Value **\]**

_\[ Body fat (%): 9 \]_

_\[ Calories: 2507 kcal \]_

_\[ Weight (kg): 78.5 \]_

_\[ sRPE: 7 \]_

You can use this format to track any single measurement. This could be for nutrition, exercise, therapy, sleep, etc. The possibilities are endless.

<br>

**_Make sure that you strictly stick to the format. It’s the only way to track data and measurements._**
